## Usage
At the top of the broswer, there are two buttons: "Record Video" and "Record Audio". To begin, select one of the buttons. Then, if you've selected "Record Video", click on the "Get Camera" button. This will ask permission to use your camera. Similarly for the "Record Audio" button, the "Get Microphone" button.  From there on both options, you will be able to record yourself and then play it back or download the recording for later.
